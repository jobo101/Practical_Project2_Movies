# Practical_Project2_Movies

Practical Project for QA Software Development

The project is to install an app that list films and allows viewers to watch films they have chosen.

Having no previous knowledge of programming I found the whole course overwhelming especially the programming. Having two days
learning python and then java.   I think it would have been nice to have a week of revision to go over everything that was 
learned throughout.  I think i was out of my depth and previous knowledge of programming would have been beneficial.
